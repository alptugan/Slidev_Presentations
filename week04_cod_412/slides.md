    <i>"The emotional, physical and aesthetic value of a sound is linked not only to the causal explanation we attribute to it but also to its own qualities of timbre and texture, to its own personal vibration. So just as directors and cinematographers (even those who will never make abstract films) have everything to gain by refining their knowledge of visual materials and textures, we can similarly benefit from disciplined attention to the inherent qualities of sounds."</i>

# Listening
When we ask someone to talk about what they have heard, their responses vary greatly depending on the type of listening they employed. 

According to Chion there are three distinct types of listening: 
1. Causal Listening
2. Semantic Listening
3. Reduced Listening

# Causal Listening
<v-clicks>

- Causal Listening is one of the most common. 
- Focuses on understanding the source of the sound.
- Listeners focus on the narrative, or the story behind the audio.

  *E.g: Shaking a gift-box.*
- We must be careful not to overestimate the accuracy and potential of causal listening. It may not be able to provide sure and precise data solely by analyzing sound. In reality, causal listening is not only the most common but also the most easily influenced and deceptive mode of listening.

# Identifying Causes: From the Unique to the General
There are various types of Causal Listening.

<v-click>

Sometimes we can identify a specific individual form his voice. 
</v-click>


<v-click>

Or we can identify a particular object by hearing the sound of it.

# Example Case: Radio Annoucer
We can listen to a radio speaker everyday without having any idea about his or her imagery. Nevertheless this does not stop us to link him or her in our memory. The physical traits of the announcer may remain blank in our mind but we can recall the individual without seeing its visual qualities like hair color, body type, or his/her name.

# Semantic Listening
Semantic listening is when listeners pay attention to the meaning and context of the audio content, such as lyrics in a song or dialogues in a movie.

Learning a spoken language.

Morse code, for instance, is a great example of semantic listening because every beep, tone, and click contributes to convey a message.

# Reduced Listening
Reduced listening is when the listener pays attention to the sound itself, independent of any contextual information.

<v-click>

Reduced listening is the term coined by <i text-yellow>Pierre Schaeffer</i> to describe a mode of listening that concentrates on the <i text-yellow>characteristics</i> of the sound itself, rather than its origin or significance.

# Requirements of Reduced Listening
<v-clicks>
<li>Sonic treats of sound.</li>
<!--  unaffected by its source or the interpretation of its significance. The physical qualities of the sound is independent from its subjective meaning. It is like arithmetics 2+2=4 which is a scientific fact.-->
<li>Pitch, timbre, frequency, amplitude, wave-length</li>
<li>Not like a solfeggio practice.</li>
<!--Sound cannot be defined solely by its physical properties. There are many other ingredients that affects the individualâ€™s perception of sound. Otherwise we call reduced listening as a traditional solfeggio paradigm.-->

<li>Creating a descriptive system for sounds</li>
<!--Schaeffer demonstrated the feasibility of creating a descriptive system for sounds that is not influenced by their cause. However, his efforts in proposing a classification system in his Traite des objets musicaux were only the beginning, and the system is not without flaws and limitations. Nevertheless, the fact that a system exists is a significant achievement.-->
<li>Disciplined attentiion on the inherent attributes of audible things.</li>

# What Is Reduced Listening Good For?
In film and television, sounds are typically used for their ability to evoke images, convey meaning, or suggest particular associations with real or imaginary causes or texts, rather than as purely formal elements in their own right.
<v-clicks>

<li>In films, sounds evoke contrete and abstract emotions</li>
<li>Film, video, art and design students can benefit from Reduced Listening</li>
<li>Not like a solfeggio practice.</li>

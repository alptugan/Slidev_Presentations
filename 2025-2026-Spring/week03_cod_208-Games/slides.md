# Syntax Matters
Some of you confused about the order. 

<img h-60 src='/syntax.png' />


```js {1|11|2|5|3|4|7|8|all}
class Name-of-the-class {
    constructor() {
        // Properties of the class
        this.name = "MyClass";
    }

    // You can add your custom functions
    someFunctionName() {

    }
}
```

# Game Types
Three main types of digital games.

Casual Games: for anybody and everybody. [Farmville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyits1Q7Zk8&ab_channel=Game_track), Cityville, pretty much any Zynga game.

Mid-Core Games: typically more investment required to succeed. Players can be punished by failing to play well. Usually a competitive atmosphere as well. Games like [Guild War 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmnPuYsJNyU&ab_channel=TheLazyPeon).

Hardcore Games:  toughest learning curves, but typically have the most invested users and highest average spenders. Kabam games come to mind, [WoW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJaANEbcjuQ&ab_channel=Throneful).

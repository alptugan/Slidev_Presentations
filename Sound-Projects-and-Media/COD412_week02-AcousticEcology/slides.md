# What is Acoustic Ecology?

<v-clicks>

- Also known as Ecoacoustics
- Studies the relationship between living organisms and their environment through sound
- Focuses on ecological and cultural significance of sound
- Examines effects of human-made sounds on natural soundscapes
- Works to preserve natural sounds and minimize noise pollution

# R. Murray Schafer

**The Father of Acoustic Ecology**

<v-clicks>

- Canadian composer, musician, and writer (1933-2021)
- Key philosophy: Treat the acoustic environment as a musical composition
- Warned about visual dominance corrupting listening abilities
- Proposed including listening courses in curriculum
- Developed the concept of "sonological competence"

# Sonological Competence

**Developing Conscious Listening**

- Practice of listening to the environment
- Exercise: List five sounds heard during a specific time (not music)
- Finding: Most students don't recall sounds "consciously"
- Solution: "Ear cleaning" exercises through soundwalks
- Goal: Increase sonic awareness

# World Soundscape Project

**Documenting Our Sonic Heritage**

<v-clicks>

- Started in early 1970s with student soundwalks
- Activities:
  - Recording soundscapes
  - Measuring amplitude levels
  - Creating isobel maps
  - Developing descriptions for sonic features
- Foundation for modern acoustic ecology research

# Element 1 - Keynote

**The Background Sounds**

- Dominant frequencies setting the tone
- Like background actors in movies
- Often not heard consciously
- **Natural environments:** wind, insects, water, forests, animals
- **Urban environments:** traffic, air conditioner, fridge, electrical noises


---
layout: default
---

# Element 2 - Signal
**The Foreground Sounds**

- Protagonist sounds of the environment
- Convey specific messages or information
- Examples:
  - Warning devices
  - Computer welcome sounds
  - Whistles
  - Horns
  - Sirens


---
layout: default
---

# Element 3 - Soundmark
**Sonic Landmarks**

- Derived from "landmark" for analogy
- Unique identifiable sounds
- Hold cultural or social significance to a location
- Examples: church bells, train whistles
- Should be preserved and protected as cultural heritage

# Hi-Fi vs Lo-Fi Soundscapes
**Pre-Industrial vs Post-Industrial**

**Hi-Fi (High Fidelity):**
- Sounds overlap less frequently
- More acoustic space
- Natural sounds in harmony
- Cyclic behavior
- Balanced in level, spectra, and rhythm

**Lo-Fi (Low Fidelity):**
- Almost constant level
- Creates "Sound Wall"
- Isolates listener from environment
- Meaningful sounds are masked

# The Sound Wall Problem
**Isolation in Lo-Fi Environments**

- Meaningful sounds become masked
- "Aural space" is reduced
- Individual cannot hear reflected sounds of own movement/speech
- Sonic information mutates into anti-information: "noise"
- Listener becomes isolated from environment

# Ecological Impact
**Sound and Species Survival**

- According to Krause (1993):
  - Spreading urban areas can "block" or "mask" spectral niches
  - Could lead to species extinctions
- Natural soundscapes have specific frequency ranges for different species
- Human noise disrupts these natural acoustic niches

# Practical Applications
**Why This Matters for Sound Design**

- Urban planning and architecture
- Environmental studies
- Creating harmonious sonic environments
- Enhancing quality of life
- Contributing to human wellbeing
- Preserving natural and cultural sonic heritage
- Soundscape Compositions

# Assignment

1. Collect sounds and classify them according to Schaefer's categories.
2. **Sound**: Create a soundscape composition using your collected material.
3. **Reading**: Refer to Other Materials (11)

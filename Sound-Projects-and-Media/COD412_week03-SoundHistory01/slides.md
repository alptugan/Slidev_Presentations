# Mask/Block "Sound Wall"

<v-click>

According to Krause (1993, 158), the spreading urban areas could "block" or "mask" spectral niches, which could lead to species extinctions.
</v-click>

<v-click>

As a result of the lo-fi soundscape, meaningful sounds (along with their associated acoustic colouration) can be masked to the point where a person's "aural space" is reduced. If an individual cannot hear the reflected sounds of his/her own movement or speech, aural space has effectively shrunk to enclose him/her, isolating him/her from the environment. In such situations, sonic information mutates into anti-information called “noise.”
</v-click>

<v-click>

Since the sound level and cycles of the sonic entities are in harmony, hi-fi soundscape maintains an identifiable experience for the listener. However, the lo-fi environments the identities cannot be separated from each easily because of the non-harmonious traits of sonic entities. Schafer says that lo-fi soundscapes creates a “Sound Wall” that isolates the individual from the environment.

# Why awareness of sound is required for the homo-urbanus?

<v-click>

Slapper (1996) reports that the number of complaints increase day by day and people are killed because of disputes between neighbours noises.
</v-click>

<v-click>

According to Schafer, environmental noise levels are increasing by 0.5 to 1 decibel per year as a result of the battle between sonic expression and control.
</v-click>

<v-click>

According to Wrightson, In the hi-fi environment, anyone who is trying to avoid their feelings (consciously or unconsciously) will experience a profound psychological fear.

# JOHN CAGE'S RULES FOR STUDENTS

<v-clicks>

- Find a place you trust and then try trusting it for a while.
- Pull everything out of your teacher.
- Pull everything out of your fellow students.
- Pull everything out of your students.
- Consider everything an experiment.
- Be self-disciplined.
- Nothing is a mistake. There's no win and no fail; there's only make.
- The only rule is work. If you work, it will lead to something.
- Don't try to create and analyze at the same time. They're different processes.
- Be happy whenever you can manage it. Enjoy yourself. It's lighter than you think.
- Always be around. Come or go to everything. Always go to classes. Read anything you can get your hands on. Save everything. It may come in handy later.

# Interactive Sound Installation (Drambo app + Notch)

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjCwz2Wq1K8) 

Wired - Interactive percussive installation using #drambo app with a couple of its physical modeling modules. Each of the four piezo mics is triggering another sound while the visuals correspond to the impact (amplitude) of the generated sounds, resulting in ever-changing interweaving of sounds and particles. Visuals #madewithnotch.

# Introduction & Background
Programming knowledge becomes a required skill more than before.

<v-clicks>

- Paradigmatic Shift in Technology Usage... But Why?

- Increasing Number of Programmers (1.1. The 4th R)

- Changing Grammars in Technology (GUI → CBI) (1.2. Emerging Tendencies)

- Fresh Problem-Solving Paradigms (1.3. Computational Creativity)
</v-clicks>

<!--Paradigmatic Shift is happening, 
Everything we do one way or another depends on computers. 
Designers, doktors, artists, citizens, everyone uses computers.
Having First Aid Education is not a must but we should have it.
HAving reading, writing, and arithmetics don't make use scientist but it is required to live in a modern society.

Why this shift happens?

# Conclusion

The act of being active actors rather than passive consumers. All actors within a social group equally affective.

Theoretical Background as <kbd>Computational Thinking</kbd> can help constructing <kbd>programming</kbd> knowledge.

<v-click>

Visual learners learn more effectively within visual stimuli.

<!--
We presume that computers or other tech devices are working. Like mobile phones. 
If we don't know how it works we cannot identify the problem. Using computers, and new tools require expilicit knowledge called progrmaming. 
To use such tools, one must have programming knowledge.
To have programming aptitude, one must have relevant problem-solving skills.
Computational Thinking can serve as a theoretical basis.-->

# Research Gap
<v-clicks>

- Contextualizing the knowledge works (Hansen, 2019; Guzdial, 2009).
- There is a need for elaborate approaches on programming educaiton (Brown & Wilson, 2018).
- Most studies focus on assesment of Computational Thinkig.
- Most studies claim that contextualizing programming practices are beneficial. 
- But how?

# Litereture Review Summary
- Programming is a tedious process for students

- The lack of inadequate computer literacy education at earlier ages <span style="color:#666">(Guzdial, 2009; Yardi & Bruckman, 2007)</span>
- The wrong choice of programming language and out-of-date course materials <span style="color:#666">(Brown & Wilson, 2018; Robins et al., 2003; Guzdial, 2009; Hansen, 2019)</span>.
- Contextualizing Programming Fundamentals with Art Increases Student Engagement <span style="color:#666">(Liao & Pope, 2008; Guzdial, 2009)</span>.

layout: center
class: pl-30 pr-30

## Theoretical Foundations

<v-clicks>

- Paradigmatic stance between Pragmatism and Constructionism
- Ontology: Interpretation/negotiation of reality. 
- Epistemology: Any relevant tool can suit to solve a problem.
- Constructionist Approach <span style="color:#ffcc00">→</span> Educational methods should be improved and backed-up within technology (Papert's Turtle/Helper libraries)
- Learners should be involved in the process. Instructing vs. Constructing Knowledge...
- Both defends the experience of the individual.
- Practical application of knowledge ~ Self construction of knowledge

## Actor-Network Theory: A birds-eye View of The Research
ANT provides an overall umbrella for the purpose of this research to analyze and develop methods and tools for the study.

- ANT ontologically aligns well with Constructionist and Pragmatist paradigms, pointing out the existence of multiple realities while analyzing the social world.
- The current state of the research problem (engagement of design students in programming classes) represents all the subjects above as macro-actors.
- "Sunsual Objects" from Harman's OOO (student prejudices).

## Research Design
The mixed-method research approach will be used to conduct the empirical (action) research approach study at ÖZÜ in COD 207/208 design students. 

The research will be conducted in three phases:
1. Literature Review (CT, AA, GA)
2. Pre- and Post-Survey Design
3. Qualitative Analysis (Interviews and Surveys)

---
layout: center
class: pl-30 pr-30
---

## Surveys & Interviews
A Linkert survey will be applied as a pre-test and post-test for students to understand their attitudes toward programming, their beliefs about the usefulness of programming, and their behaviors related to programming. 

- Pre-test at the begining of the semester.
- Post-test at the end of the semester.
- Interviews will be carried out during the study.

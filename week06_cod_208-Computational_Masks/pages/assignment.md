# Assignments

1. 👀 Implement all of the scenes that you design for your game in P5Js.
2. You can use the codes in my game and implement to yours. Fork my [game template](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2191906) to adapt your game scenes. For those who have different game mechanics than my game, do your best. I want to see the implemented design in P5Js. Please ask to me or your friends in class whenever you need help or get stuck!!! I can provide you tutorials and reference code snippets. 
2. ⏫ Upload the sketch to your openProcessing account.
3. ❗Submit the openprocessing link.
4. ❗Submit the sketch source code as zip file as well.

## "Whenever the speech is corrupted so is the mind"


<span text-gray italic>- Lucius Annaeus Seneca</span>

<br>

<v-click >

Speech is made of words, and the words have meaning. These are grouped together to form thoughts or ideas and to move them from one person to another. If you can corrupt the speech, by banning words or concepts, everything else is corrupted as well.

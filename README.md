# Slidev_Presentations

Includes my course and workshop presentations built with slidev.js

<details>
  <summary><span style="color:gray;">Build From Source Instructions</span></summary>

1. Follow the instruction on slidev.js Github page.
2. Create the slideshow using markdown and html.
3. To run preview in real-time locally;
   1. Duplicate the ```template``` folder.
   2. Rename it.
   3. Open it on VS Code.
   4. Open Terminal run ```slidev -o```
   5. Add all images into ```public```folder.
4. To deploy the presentation
   1. If the source files are located in a subfolder under the root, you must set the ```--base``` parameter. This **required** in order to load relevant files and assets properly on a Github page or your custom domain.
   2. Run ```slidev build --base /Name_of_the_Repo/Name_of_the_subfolder/dist/```
   E.g. ```slidev build --base /Slidev_Presentations/OMM_Arduino_Workshop/dist/```

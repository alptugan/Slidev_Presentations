# Slidev_Presentations
 Includes my course and workshop presentations built with slidev.js

1. Follow the instruction on slidev.js Github page.
2. Create the slideshow using markdown and html.
3. To run preview in real-time locally;
   1. Duplicate the ```template``` folder.
   2. Rename it.
   3. Open it on VS Code.
   4. Open Terminal run ```slidev -o```
   5. Add all images into ```public```folder.
4. To deploy the presentation
   1. If the source files are located in a subfolder under the root, you must set the ```--base``` parameter. This **required** in order to load relevant files and assets properly on a Github page or your custom domain.
   2. Run ```slidev build --base /Name_of_the_Repo/Name_of_the_subfolder/dist/```
   E.g. ```slidev build --base /Slidev_Presentations/OMM_Arduino_Workshop/dist/```

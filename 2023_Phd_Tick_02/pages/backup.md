## Research Design
The mixed-method research approach will be used to conduct the empirical (action) research approach study at ÖZÜ in COD 207/208 design students. 

The research will be conducted in three phases:
1. Literature Review (CT, AA, GA) 
2. Pre- and Post-Survey Design
3. Qualitative Analysis (Interviews and Surveys)

## Surveys & Interviews
A Linkert survey will be applied as a pre-test and post-test for students to understand their attitudes toward programming, their beliefs about the usefulness of programming, and their behaviors related to programming. 

- Pre-test at the begining of the semester.
- Post-test at the end of the semester.
- Interviews will be carried out during the study.

## Theoretical Foundations

<v-clicks>

- Paradigmatic stance between Pragmatism and Constructionism
- Ontology: Interpretation/negotiation of reality. 
- Epistemology: Any relevant tool can suit to solve a problem (Algorithmic Art Praxis)
- Constructionist Approach <span style="color:#ffcc00">→</span> Educational methods should be improved and backed-up within technology (Papert's Turtle/Helper libraries: p5.Utils)
- Learners should be involved in the process. Instructing vs. Constructing Knowledge...
- Both defends the experience of the individual.
- Practical application of knowledge ~ Self construction of knowledge

## Actor-Network Theory: A birds-eye View of The Research
ANT provides an overall umbrella for the purpose of this research to analyze and develop methods and tools for the study.

- ANT ontologically aligns well with Constructionist and Pragmatist paradigms, pointing out the existence of multiple realities while analyzing the social world.
- The current state of the research problem (engagement of design students in programming classes) represents all the subjects above as macro-actors.
- "Sensual Objects" from Harman's OOO (student prejudices).

# Assignments

1. Make a 5 x 5 grid. Canvas size must be 620 x 620 px.
2. Each grid must be a square with the same witdh and height in px. 
3. There must be 100 px margin from top-right-bottom-left sides of the canvas. 5 x 5 grid must be in the middle of the canvas.
4. Draw circles in the middle of each grid in random size between of your choice in min and max value. 
5. Write down your steps using Computational Thinking Framework 1️⃣0️⃣ PTS;
    1. **Decompose**: Explain what shapes and actions you need to create the sketch, RGB color values, variables like x and y, or the size of shapes, etc...
    2. **Pattern Recognition**: Explain the repeating behavior. 
    3. **Abstraction**: Write-down translation of the decomposed items. E.g square: In p5JS we can draw a square using rect(x,y,w,h) or square(x,y,size) functions, etc...
    4. **Algorithm**: Briefly write-down the instructions to draw the final image.

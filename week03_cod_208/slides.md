# Game Types
Three main types of digital games.

Casual Games: for anybody and everybody. [Farmville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyits1Q7Zk8&ab_channel=Game_track), Cityville, pretty much any [Zynga](https://www.zynga.com/games/) game.

Mid-Core Games: Typically more investment required to succeed. Usually a competitive atmosphere as well. Games like [Guild War 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmnPuYsJNyU&ab_channel=TheLazyPeon).

Hardcore Games:  Toughest learning curves, but typically have the most invested users and highest average spenders. [Kabam](https://kabam.com/games/) games come to mind, [WoW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJaANEbcjuQ&ab_channel=Throneful).

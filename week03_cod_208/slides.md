<!--Artists such as Gilbert and George, Jeff Koons, and Takashi Murakami have embraced the use of software in their creative processes. Architects, designers, video game developers, and Hollywood animators all utilize software to bring their ideas to life. Custom programs are often commissioned to perfect their visions.-->

# Jeff Koons

<div v-click>
  Koons' use of digital technology is in his "Easyfun-Ethereal" series, which features digitally rendered images of food and other consumer goods. Koons uses 3D modeling software to create the images, which are then printed onto canvas or other materials using a digital printing process.
</div>
<br>
<div v-click>
  Overall, while Jeff Koons is not a digital artist per se, he has embraced digital technology as a tool in the creation of some of his works, blurring the lines between traditional and digital art forms.

# Takashi Murakami

<div v-click>
Murakami is not typically considered a software artist, he has collaborated with software developers and designers to create interactive and digital artworks.
</div>
<br>
<div v-click>
Murakami's use of software in his art is his collaboration with the Japanese video game company, Capcom. In 2012, Murakami worked with Capcom to design a video game called "Asura's Wrath," for which he created the game's final boss character and an ending sequence featuring his signature flower motifs.

# Superflat Monogram for Luis Vitton

<div style="margin-right:40px">
One example of Takashi Murakami's digital artwork is "Superflat Monogram," which is a collaboration with Louis Vuitton. "Superflat Monogram" is a series of animated short films that feature Murakami's signature anime-inspired characters and motifs, alongside the iconic Louis Vuitton monogram pattern. The films were created using a combination of hand-drawn and computer animation techniques, and were originally shown as part of a larger installation at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in 2007.

# What is Code?

Codes typically serve three primary purposes. Namely; communication, clarification, or obfuscation.

# Qualities of an Algorithm

<v-clicks>

1. üó∫Ô∏è [MULTIPLENESS] There is not just single way to create an algorithm.
2. ü§î [ASSUMPTIONS] There must be determined conditions.
3. üëâ [DECISIONS] An algorithm includes decisions.
4. üÉè [MODULAR] Algorithms should be broken down into modular pieces.

# Computers & Code

Writing in a human language allows the author to utilize the ambiguity of words and to have great flexibility in constructing phrases. These techniques allow multiple interpretations of a single text and give each author a unique voice. Each computer program also reveals the style of its author, but there is far less room for ambiguity.[^1]

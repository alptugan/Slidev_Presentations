# What is Interaction?
A cyclic process that involves at least two actors;

- Actors build a dialogue between each other. 
- Recall Campbell's *interactive systems*?
- A successful interaction depends on the quality of each subtask.
  - üëÇListening, 
  - üí¨ Thinking,
  - üó£Ô∏è Speaking.

# What Crawford says?

Interaction is a process in which two actors alternately listen, ask questions, and speak to each other in a cyclic manner. Interactivity must involve an iterative process. The conversation goes back and forth between actors. The quality of the interaction is technically;

# Refregirator Case

Extending the branch argument, some claim that when you open a refrigerator and the little light inside turns on, and then you close the door and the light turns off, you are interacting with the refrigerator because it responds to your actions

<!-- https://sli.dev/guide/syntax.html#line-highlighting -->

```js {1|2|4-6|8-10}
function setRefregiratorLigh(value) {
    let lightState = value;
    
    if(lightState == "ON") {
      // Turn on the lights
    }
    
    else if(lightState == "OFF") {
      // Turn of the lights
    }
}
```

<!-- 
 There are two actors not one. But it doesn't mean that technologies we are using in our daily life are a matter of actor. They are just tools. You open the refregirator's door and the light turns on, you close the door and it turns off. This isn't an interaction. This is just a reaction.
- There must be an intellectual dignity. Refrigerator listens to your action, thinks by switching on/off the switch, and speaks to do on or off the light. But this kind of interaction is simple.

# Is Everthing Subjective?
>Plenty of people claim that everything is subjective, so I won‚Äôt try to convince you if you belong to that tribe. But if you‚Äôre willing to grant the existence of occasional objective truths, here‚Äôs an explanation that offers some practical value for a designer.

# Reading a Book?
Is reading a book interactive act?

<v-click>

A book can't listen or think.
</v-click>

<v-click>

A book can only speak; it speaks its words as we read them. 
</v-click>

<v-click>

Eventually, a book cannot interpret your feelings, thoughts...

# Dancing?

<v-click>

>While dancing with another does provide an avenue of interaction, the interaction is between the dancers, not between the *dancers* and the *music*.
</v-click>

<v-click>

Dancing alone to the music is not interaction
</v-click>

<v-click>

it is participation

# User Interface (UI)
<p color-white style="opacity:100">The study of user interface is a contemporary derivative of the field of human factors. Its scope is relatively narrow, with the aim of enhancing the interaction between individuals and electronic devices. Consequently, some individuals may favor the term "human-computer interface" to describe this field. This discipline prioritizes communication over interactivity.</p>

<v-click>

Interactivity design focuses on optimizing the user-computer thought process and differs from user interface design, which only optimizes communication. User interface design doesn't address software's thinking content or core behaviors.

# Graphic Design and Multimedia
Some confuse graphic design with interactivity design, but visually effective page design is only part of the overall interactivity design task. 

<v-click>

The idea of separating design into graphic and "interactivizing" steps is erroneous since good interactivity design integrates form with function. 
</v-click>

<v-click>

Holding onto expertise in graphic design without embracing interactivity design makes one a graphic designer, not an interactivity designer.
